+## Status: DRAFT
+
+## Definition:
+
+A _key_ is a Java type and an optional [qualifier].
+
+Dagger uses keys to associate [dependency requests] and [bindings].
+
+## Examples:
+
+The following are examples of keys:
+
+```java
+String
+@Blue String
+
+List<String>
+@Red List<String>
+@Green List<? extends CharSequence>
+```
+
+<!-- TODO(ronshapiro): It may be good to have this in a different style to give
+a visual aid that it's an "advanced" section. -->
+
+## Advanced
+
+Although keys are built on Java's type system, they cannot be used 
+interchangeably with keys that have assignable Java types. For example, in Java,
+the following code is valid, even though the type on the left-hand side is
+different from the type on the right-hand side.
+
+```java
+List<String> l = new ArrayList<String>();
+```
+
+Within Dagger, the _keys_ `List<String>` and `ArrayList<String>` are completely
+different and cannot be used interchangeably. Similarly, `@Red String` and
+`@Blue String` are also unrelated, even though they have the same Java type,
+because they have different qualifiers.
+
+There is one exception to this rule: keys for primitives (like `int`) are
+interchangeable with the keys for their boxed type (i.e. `java.lang.Integer`).
+
+<!-- TODO(ronshapiro): Add a note for Kotlin users about declaration-site
+variance and how it comes into play with keys. -->
