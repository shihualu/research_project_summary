+# example-async
+
+This example is modified from the 'simple' coffee example.
+
+It attempts to show how Dagger can instantiate components in parallel using the annotations in the dagger.producers package.
+
+
+The changes made to the simple coffee example are:
+
+ * CoffeeApp is now annotated with @ProductionComponent and has to supply an Executor to the Builder.
+	
+ * AsyncCoffeeModule is an @ProducerModule which produces the CoffeeMaker and Grinder
+ 
+ * CoffeeMaker now uses a Grinder (so we can construct the Pump and Grinder in parallel)
+ 
+ * PumpModule is now an @ProducerModule
+ 
+ * println has been added so we can easily follow the injections
+ 
+ 
+Running CoffeeApp.main produces the following output:
+
+	@Provide Heater
+	@Inject Thermosiphon
+	@Producing Pump..
+	@Producing Grinder..
+	done @Producing Grinder
+	done @Producing Pump
+	@Producing CoffeeMaker..
+	~ ~ ~ grinding ~ ~ ~
+	~ ~ ~ heating ~ ~ ~
+	=> => pumping => =>
+	 [_]P coffee! [_]P 
+ 
+ This shows that
+ 
+ * The Heater is created first as it's needed for the Thermosiphon constructor.
+ 
+ * The Pump and Grinder are then created in parallel.
+ 
+ * The CoffeeMaker is not produced until the Pump and Grinder are available.
+ 
+ If you reduce the size of the thread pool executor to 1, then you will see that the Pump and Grinder are not created in parallel.
+ 
+## Snags
+
+Running against 2.1-SNAPSHOT on 2016-01-22
+ 
+ * mvn clean compile fails:
+ 
+	coffee2/AsyncCoffeeModule_ProduceMakerFactory.java:[60,19] cannot find symbol
+	symbol:   method transformAsync(com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture<java.util.List<java.lang.Object>>,<anonymous com.google.common.util.concurrent.AsyncFunction<java.util.List<java.lang.Object>,coffee2.CoffeeMaker>>,java.util.concurrent.Executor)
+	location: class com.google.common.util.concurrent.Futures 
+
+Manually editing the generated code to refer to transform() instead of transformAsync() seems to fix the problem.
+
+Running from git HEAD on 2016-01-22, mvn still failed, but it was OK in Eclipse because Futures resolved to guava-19. When running against 2.1-SNAPSHOT, Futures resolved to within the dagger snapshot.
