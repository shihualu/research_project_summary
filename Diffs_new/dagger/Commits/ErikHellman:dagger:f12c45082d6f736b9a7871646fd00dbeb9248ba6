+## Status: DRAFT
+
+## Definition:
+
+A _binding graph_ comprises the [bindings][binding] and
+[dependency requests][dependency request] that are used to implement a
+[component]. It is a [directed graph] with an edge for each
+[dependency request], whose target is the [binding] that satisfies the request,
+and whose source is either the binding that contains the request or, in the case
+of [entry points][entry point], the [component] that contains the [entry point].
+
+For example, look at the following component:
+
+```java
+@Component
+interface Test {
+  A a();
+}
+
+class A {
+  @Inject A(B b, C c) {}
+}
+
+class B {
+  @Inject B(C c) {}
+}
+
+class C {
+  @Inject C() {}
+}
+```
+
+The binding graph for `TestComponent` is below. There is one entry point,
+represented by an edge from the `Test` component node.

+
+Note that each [binding] is associated with a [key], which matches the [key] of
+the incoming [dependency request].
