+title: Dagger SPI
+---
+
+The Dagger [SPI] is a mechanism to hook into Dagger's annotation processor and
+access the same binding graph  model that Dagger uses. With the SPI, you can
+write a plugin that
+
+- adds project-specific errors and warnings, e.g. `Bindings for
+  android.content.Context must have a @Qualifier` or `Bindings that implement
+  DatabaseRelated must be scoped`
+- generates extra Java source files
+- serializes the Dagger model to a resource file
+- builds visualizations of the Dagger model
+- and more!
+
+The opportunities are endless, which is why the SPI is open for anyone to use!
+
+> Note: The APIs for implementing an SPI plugin are experimental and are free to
+change. All changes will be documented in our [GitHub releases
+page](https://github.com/google/dagger/releases).We encourage you to [reach
+out] when you find rough edges so we can make the APIs easier to use.
+
+## Declaring your SPI plugin
+
+SPI plugins are classes that implement [`BindingGraphPlugin`] and are loaded
+using Java's [`ServiceLoader`] (easily done by using [`@AutoService`]. Your
+`BindingGraphPlugin` should be available alongside Dagger on the annotation
+processor path during compilation so that it can be loaded. In Bazel that is done
+with a [`java_plugin`]; in Gradle declare a dependency with
+`annotationProcessor` scope.
+
+When Dagger detects an SPI plugin on the classpath, it will call its
+[`visitGraph(BindingGraph, DiagnosticReporter)`][`visitGraph()`] method for each
+valid `@Component` that Dagger compiles. The `BindingGraph` is implemented as a
+[`Network`] that has nodes for [components][component nodes], [bindings][binding
+nodes], and [missing bindings][missing binding nodes]. Edges in the graph
+represent [dependencies][dependency edges] as well as parent-child component
+relationships. For more, please refer to the [javadoc][BindingGraph javadoc].
+
+## Adding Errors and Warnings
+
+Plugins can use [`DiagnosticReporter`] to report project-specific errors and
+warnings. These diagnostics will be passed to the [`Messager`] with additional
+information to help users debug the issue. For example, an invalid
+`DependencyEdge` will also print a dependency trace from a component to the
+dependency, similar to regular Dagger errors. In fact, for those that are
+familiar with writing annotation processors, the `DiagnosticReporter` methods
+will look familiar to those on `Messager` except that they take `BindingGraph`
+nodes and edges instead of `Element`s.
+
+All reported diagnostics will be prefixed with `[<plugin name>]` so that users
+can easily identify the source/category of the diagnostic. The plugin name
+defaults the fully qualified class name of the `BindingGraphPlugin`, but can be
+configured by returning a value for `BindingGraphPlugin.pluginName()`.
+
+## Generating files
+
+If you'd like to generate files based on the binding graph, you can obtain an
+instance of a [`Filer`] from the [`BindingGraph.initFiler()`] method. The filer
+can be used within `visitGraph()` to generate files just like a normal
+annotation processor would.
+
+One common use case for generating files is to serialize the binding graph model
+to JSON/proto for a UI to use later to help users visualize the binding
+graph. (P.S.: If you write a really awesome visualization tool, let us know so we
+can promote it!)
+
+## `Types` and `Elements`
+
+Annotation processors are given an instance of [`Types`] in order to simplify
+code that interfaces with Java's type system, as well as an instance of
+[`Elements`] for code that interfaces with source code elements. SPI plugins can
+obtain references to these types via the [`BindingGraph.initTypes()`] and
+[`BindingGraph.initElements()`] methods.
+
+## Command line options
+
+SPI plugins may declare a set of supported command line options with the
+`BindingGraph.supportedOptions()` method. If any of these are passed to `javac`,
+Dagger will forward the values to the `initOptions()` method.
