+## Status: DRAFT
+
+## Definition:
+
+A _dependency request_ is a declaration that Dagger is required to provide an
+object associated with a specific [key]. There are several kinds of dependency
+requests. For each, its type (and optional [qualifier] annotation) determine its
+key.
+
+*   An [entry point] is an abstract, non-`void` method with no parameters on a
+    [component].
+*   A parameter of an [`@Inject`]-annotated constructor or method.
+*   An [`@Inject`]-annotated field.
+*   A parameter of a [binding method], such as a method annotated with
+    [`@Provides`] or [`@Binds`].
+
+In each case, Dagger will use the [binding] associated with the requested [key]
+to _satisfy_ the request by implementing the entry point, setting the field, or
+passing a value to the parameter.
