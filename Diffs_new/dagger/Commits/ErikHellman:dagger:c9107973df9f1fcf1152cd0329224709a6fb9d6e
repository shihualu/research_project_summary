+title: Kythe integration
+---
+
+Dagger integrates with [Kythe] to add edges that represent the binding and
+module graphs.
+
+Dagger adds the following edges to the Kythe graph:
+
+-   `/inject/satisfiedby` from a [dependency request] to the [binding][](s) that
+    satisfiy the request (in at least one component)
+-   `/inject/installsmodule` from each [component] to all of the [modules]
+    installed by the component. This includes the transitive set of modules
+    included with `@Module(includes = ...)`
+-   `/inject/childcomponent` from each [component] to their direct child
+    components
+
+
+Because Kythe interfaces well with the [Language Server Protocol], IDE tools
+could be built on top of this (though none have been yet).
