+# Design Philosophy
+
+1.  The implementation is purely generated code. The *structure* of the binding
+graph — how your provisions and dependency requests relate to each other within
+a component — should be fully defined and inspectable at compile time. All
+dynamism lives outside the structure of the graph.
+
+<!-- TODO(gak): elaborate on why this is a virtue. -->
+
+1.  The generated code should be simple and intuitive — this includes the
+_implementation_.  Wherever practical the generated code should look and feel
+like user-written, idiomatic Java.
+
+1.  Users should interact with generated API as little as possible.  (See
+[the research][auto-value-generate-api] done by `@AutoValue`, which heavily
+influences this goal.)
+
+1. The generated code should be portable. As simple, idomatic Java code, it
+should strive to be applicable in any environment in which source is compiled.
