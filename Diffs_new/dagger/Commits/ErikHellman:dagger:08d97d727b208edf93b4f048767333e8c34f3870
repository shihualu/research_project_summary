+## fastInit mode
+
+You can choose to generate your Dagger [`@Component`]s in a mode that
+prioritizes fast initialization. Normally, the number of classes loaded when
+initializing a component (i.e., when calling `DaggerFooComponent.create()` or
+`DaggerFooComponent.builder()...build()`) scales with the number of bindings in
+the component. In "fastInit" mode, it doesn’t. There are tradeoffs, however.
+Normally, each [`Provider`] you inject holds a reference to providers
+of all its transitive dependencies; in fastInit mode, each
+[`Provider`] holds a reference to the entire component, including all
+scoped instances.
+
+You should evaluate this tradeoff for your application when choosing to build in
+fastInit mode. Take care to measure your application’s startup time with and
+without fastInit mode to see how much benefit it has for your users. (Please let
+us know whether it’s working for you!) In general, for environments like Android
+where Dagger initialization is often on the user’s critical path and where class
+loading is expensive, consider using fastInit mode.
+
+To enable fastInit mode, pass the following option to javac when building your
+[`@Component`]: `-Adagger.fastInit=enabled`
