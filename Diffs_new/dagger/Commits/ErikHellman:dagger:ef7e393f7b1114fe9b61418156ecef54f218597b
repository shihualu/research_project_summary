+title: Conflicting `@Inject`
+---
+
+In general, Dagger does not allow a conflicting binding for the same key in a
+subcomponent and an ancestor component. There are two exceptions:
+
+*   A subcomponent can replace an absent [`@BindsOptionalOf`] binding with an
+    explicit binding.
+*   A subcomponent can add entries or elements to a multibinding.
+
+It was never supposed to be possible for a subcomponent to have an explicit
+binding for a class if its [`@Inject`] binding was used in an ancestor
+component. However, that validation was mistakenly never implemented.
+
+If an explicit binding in a subcomponent conflicts with an [`@Inject`] binding
+in an ancestor component, Dagger now reports a warning. To make those into
+errors, pass `-Adagger.explicitBindingConflictsWithInject=ERROR` to `javac`.
+
+You have a few options to fix these conflicts:
+
+1.  Decide whether you really need both the [`@Inject`] binding and the explicit
+    binding. If you need only the [`@Inject`] binding, you can delete the
+    explicit one. If you need only the explicit one, you can move that into a
+    module installed in the ancestor component, where it will replace the
+    [`@Inject`] binding.
+
+2.  If you need both, then one or the other must be qualified. If one of the
+    bindings is used from only a few places, qualify that one. To qualify the
+    explicit binding, just add a qualifier. You cannot qualify an [`@Inject`]
+    binding, so instead you must write an explicit qualified [`@Provides`]
+    method in a module installed in the ancestor component, which calls the
+    constructor explicitly. In either case, you have to add the qualifier to the
+    dependency requests that you want to use the qualified binding.
