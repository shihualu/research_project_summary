 We are formally separating network adapters from our MoPub SDK. This is to enable an independent release cadence resulting in faster updates and certification cycles. New mediation location is accessible [here](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-mediation).  
 
 We have also added an additional tool, making it easy for publishers to get up and running with the mediation integration. Check out https://developers.mopub.com/docs/mediation/integrate/ and integration instructions at https://developers.mopub.com/docs/android/integrating-networks/.

+# Google AdSense SDK
+
+Although the AdSense SDK for Android is deprecated, you can support it by doing the following:
+
+1) Copy AdSenseAdapter.java under the extras/ folder to mopub-android-sdk/src/com/mopub/mobileads
+2) Place the Google AdSense SDK in mopub-android-sdk/libs
+3) Add GoogleAdView.jar to the Java Build Path in the Properties section of mopub-android-sdk.
+
+*NOTE: At this time, Google does not allow distribution of GoogleAdView.jar so you will need to get that file from Google*
