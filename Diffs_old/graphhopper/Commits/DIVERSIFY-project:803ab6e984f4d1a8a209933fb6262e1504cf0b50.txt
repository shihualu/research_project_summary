- * guide for the arrow - its width, height, and offset are theme-dependent and
- * should be expessed as left, right, top, bottom, so that the element bearing
- * such a class becomes stretched inside its parent position: relative element.
- * The left/top/right/bottom specified below should reflect the corresponding
- * border radii and so it leaves room for the shadow:
- *     ..--------------------..
- *   ."        ^ top           ".
- *  /          v                 \
- * |     +------------------+     |

- *   `.        v bottom        .'
- *     ""--------------------""
- * The idea is that the top/left of the arrow container box does not move to a
- * coordinate smaller than the top/left of the guide and the right/bottom of
- * the arrow container box does not move to a coordinate larger than the
- * bottom/right of the guide. This will help us avoid the following situation:
- *        ..--------------------..
- *      ."        ^ top           ".
- *   /|/          v                 \
- *  / |     +------------------+     |
- *  \ |     |                  |     |
- *   \| left|                  |right|
- *    |<--->|                  |<--->|
- *    |     +------------------+     |
- *     \          ^                 /
- *      `.        v bottom        .'
- *        ""--------------------""
- * The arrow should not receive a top/left coordinate such that it is too close
- * to one of the corners, because then at first the shadow of the arrow and,
- * given a coordinate even closer to the corner, even the body of the arrow will
- * "stick out" of the corner of the popup. The guide provides a hint to the
- * arrow positioning code as to which range of values is acceptable for the
- * arrow container's top/left coordinate.

-// About: Examples
-// 
-// These working examples, complete with fully commented code, illustrate a few
-// ways in which this plugin can be used.
-// 
-// hashchange event - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/hashchange/
-// document.domain - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/document_domain/
-// 
-// About: Support and Testing
-// 
-// Information about what version or versions of jQuery this plugin has been
-// tested with, what browsers it has been tested in, and where the unit tests
-// reside (so you can test it yourself).
-// 
-// jQuery Versions - 1.2.6, 1.3.2, 1.4.1, 1.4.2
-// Browsers Tested - Internet Explorer 6-8, Firefox 2-4, Chrome 5-6, Safari 3.2-5,
-//                   Opera 9.6-10.60, iPhone 3.1, Android 1.6-2.2, BlackBerry 4.6-5.
-// Unit Tests      - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/unit/
-// 
-// About: Known issues
-// 
-// While this jQuery hashchange event implementation is quite stable and
-// robust, there are a few unfortunate browser bugs surrounding expected
-// hashchange event-based behaviors, independent of any JavaScript
-// window.onhashchange abstraction. See the following examples for more
-// information:
-// 
-// Chrome: Back Button - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/bug-chrome-back-button/
-// Firefox: Remote XMLHttpRequest - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/bug-firefox-remote-xhr/
-// WebKit: Back Button in an Iframe - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/bug-webkit-hash-iframe/
-// Safari: Back Button from a different domain - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/bug-safari-back-from-diff-domain/
-// 
-// Also note that should a browser natively support the window.onhashchange 
-// event, but not report that it does, the fallback polling loop will be used.
-// 
-// About: Release History
-// 
-// 1.3   - (7/21/2010) Reorganized IE6/7 Iframe code to make it more
-//         "removable" for mobile-only development. Added IE6/7 document.title
-//         support. Attempted to make Iframe as hidden as possible by using
-//         techniques from http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=604. Added 
-//         support for the "shortcut" format $(window).hashchange( fn ) and
-//         $(window).hashchange() like jQuery provides for built-in events.
-//         Renamed jQuery.hashchangeDelay to <jQuery.fn.hashchange.delay> and
-//         lowered its default value to 50. Added <jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain>
-//         and <jQuery.fn.hashchange.src> properties plus document-domain.html
-//         file to address access denied issues when setting document.domain in
-//         IE6/7.
-// 1.2   - (2/11/2010) Fixed a bug where coming back to a page using this plugin
-//         from a page on another domain would cause an error in Safari 4. Also,
-//         IE6/7 Iframe is now inserted after the body (this actually works),
-//         which prevents the page from scrolling when the event is first bound.
-//         Event can also now be bound before DOM ready, but it won't be usable
-//         before then in IE6/7.
-// 1.1   - (1/21/2010) Incorporated document.documentMode test to fix IE8 bug
-//         where browser version is incorrectly reported as 8.0, despite
-//         inclusion of the X-UA-Compatible IE=EmulateIE7 meta tag.
-// 1.0   - (1/9/2010) Initial Release. Broke out the jQuery BBQ event.special
-//         window.onhashchange functionality into a separate plugin for users
-//         who want just the basic event & back button support, without all the
-//         extra awesomeness that BBQ provides. This plugin will be included as
-//         part of jQuery BBQ, but also be available separately.

-  // Method: jQuery.fn.hashchange
-  // 
-  // Bind a handler to the window.onhashchange event or trigger all bound
-  // window.onhashchange event handlers. This behavior is consistent with
-  // jQuery's built-in event handlers.
-  // 
-  // Usage:
-  // 
-  // > jQuery(window).hashchange( [ handler ] );
-  // 
-  // Arguments:
-  // 
-  //  handler - (Function) Optional handler to be bound to the hashchange
-  //    event. This is a "shortcut" for the more verbose form:
-  //    jQuery(window).bind( 'hashchange', handler ). If handler is omitted,
-  //    all bound window.onhashchange event handlers will be triggered. This
-  //    is a shortcut for the more verbose
-  //    jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' ). These forms are described in
-  //    the <hashchange event> section.
-  // 
-  // Returns:
-  // 
-  //  (jQuery) The initial jQuery collection of elements.
-  
-  // Allow the "shortcut" format $(elem).hashchange( fn ) for binding and
-  // $(elem).hashchange() for triggering, like jQuery does for built-in events.

-    return fn ? this.bind( str_hashchange, fn ) : this.trigger( str_hashchange );
-  };
-  
-  // Property: jQuery.fn.hashchange.delay
-  // 
-  // The numeric interval (in milliseconds) at which the <hashchange event>
-  // polling loop executes. Defaults to 50.
-  
-  // Property: jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain
-  // 
-  // If you're setting document.domain in your JavaScript, and you want hash
-  // history to work in IE6/7, not only must this property be set, but you must
-  // also set document.domain BEFORE jQuery is loaded into the page. This
-  // property is only applicable if you are supporting IE6/7 (or IE8 operating
-  // in "IE7 compatibility" mode).
-  // 
-  // In addition, the <jQuery.fn.hashchange.src> property must be set to the
-  // path of the included "document-domain.html" file, which can be renamed or
-  // modified if necessary (note that the document.domain specified must be the
-  // same in both your main JavaScript as well as in this file).
-  // 
-  // Usage:
-  // 
-  // jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain = document.domain;
-  
-  // Property: jQuery.fn.hashchange.src
-  // 
-  // If, for some reason, you need to specify an Iframe src file (for example,
-  // when setting document.domain as in <jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain>), you can
-  // do so using this property. Note that when using this property, history
-  // won't be recorded in IE6/7 until the Iframe src file loads. This property
-  // is only applicable if you are supporting IE6/7 (or IE8 operating in "IE7
-  // compatibility" mode).
-  // 
-  // Usage:
-  // 
-  // jQuery.fn.hashchange.src = 'path/to/file.html';
-  
-  $.fn[ str_hashchange ].delay = 50;
-  /*
-  $.fn[ str_hashchange ].domain = null;
-  $.fn[ str_hashchange ].src = null;
-  */
-  
-  // Event: hashchange event
-  // 
-  // Fired when location.hash changes. In browsers that support it, the native
-  // HTML5 window.onhashchange event is used, otherwise a polling loop is
-  // initialized, running every <jQuery.fn.hashchange.delay> milliseconds to
-  // see if the hash has changed. In IE6/7 (and IE8 operating in "IE7
-  // compatibility" mode), a hidden Iframe is created to allow the back button
-  // and hash-based history to work.
-  // 
-  // Usage as described in <jQuery.fn.hashchange>:
-  // 
-  // > // Bind an event handler.
-  // > jQuery(window).hashchange( function(e) {
-  // >   var hash = location.hash;
-  // >   ...
-  // > });
-  // > 
-  // > // Manually trigger the event handler.
-  // > jQuery(window).hashchange();
-  // 
-  // A more verbose usage that allows for event namespacing:
-  // 
-  // > // Bind an event handler.
-  // > jQuery(window).bind( 'hashchange', function(e) {
-  // >   var hash = location.hash;
-  // >   ...
-  // > });
-  // > 
-  // > // Manually trigger the event handler.
-  // > jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' );
-  // 
-  // Additional Notes:
-  // 
-  // * The polling loop and Iframe are not created until at least one handler
-  //   is actually bound to the 'hashchange' event.
-  // * If you need the bound handler(s) to execute immediately, in cases where
-  //   a location.hash exists on page load, via bookmark or page refresh for
-  //   example, use jQuery(window).hashchange() or the more verbose 
-  //   jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' ).
-  // * The event can be bound before DOM ready, but since it won't be usable
-  //   before then in IE6/7 (due to the necessary Iframe), recommended usage is
-  //   to bind it inside a DOM ready handler.
-  
-  // Override existing $.event.special.hashchange methods (allowing this plugin
-  // to be defined after jQuery BBQ in BBQ's source code).

-/* Dimensions related to the popup arrow

-/**
- * guide for the arrow - its width, height, and offset are theme-dependent and
- * should be expessed as left, right, top, bottom, so that the element bearing
- * such a class becomes stretched inside its parent position: relative element.
- * The left/top/right/bottom specified below should reflect the corresponding
- * border radii and so it leaves room for the shadow:
- *     ..--------------------..
- *   ."        ^ top           ".
- *  /          v                 \
- * |     +------------------+     |
- * |     |                  |     |
- * | left|                  |right|
- * |<--->|                  |<--->|

- *  \          ^                 /
- *   `.        v bottom        .'
- *     ""--------------------""
- * The idea is that the top/left of the arrow container box does not move to a
- * coordinate smaller than the top/left of the guide and the right/bottom of
- * the arrow container box does not move to a coordinate larger than the
- * bottom/right of the guide. This will help us avoid the following situation:
- *        ..--------------------..
- *      ."        ^ top           ".
- *   /|/          v                 \
- *  / |     +------------------+     |
- *  \ |     |                  |     |
- *   \| left|                  |right|
- *    |<--->|                  |<--->|
- *    |     +------------------+     |
- *     \          ^                 /
- *      `.        v bottom        .'
- *        ""--------------------""
- * The arrow should not receive a top/left coordinate such that it is too close
- * to one of the corners, because then at first the shadow of the arrow and,

- * guide for the arrow - its width, height, and offset are theme-dependent and
- * should be expessed as left, right, top, bottom, so that the element bearing
- * such a class becomes stretched inside its parent position: relative element.
- * The left/top/right/bottom specified below should reflect the corresponding
- * border radii and so it leaves room for the shadow:
- *     ..--------------------..
- *   ."        ^ top           ".
- *  /          v                 \
- * |     +------------------+     |

- *   `.        v bottom        .'
- *     ""--------------------""
- * The idea is that the top/left of the arrow container box does not move to a
- * coordinate smaller than the top/left of the guide and the right/bottom of
- * the arrow container box does not move to a coordinate larger than the
- * bottom/right of the guide. This will help us avoid the following situation:
- *        ..--------------------..
- *      ."        ^ top           ".
- *   /|/          v                 \
- *  / |     +------------------+     |
- *  \ |     |                  |     |
- *   \| left|                  |right|
- *    |<--->|                  |<--->|
- *    |     +------------------+     |
- *     \          ^                 /
- *      `.        v bottom        .'
- *        ""--------------------""
- * The arrow should not receive a top/left coordinate such that it is too close
- * to one of the corners, because then at first the shadow of the arrow and,
- * given a coordinate even closer to the corner, even the body of the arrow will
- * "stick out" of the corner of the popup. The guide provides a hint to the
- * arrow positioning code as to which range of values is acceptable for the
- * arrow container's top/left coordinate.

-/**
- * guide for the arrow - its width, height, and offset are theme-dependent and
- * should be expessed as left, right, top, bottom, so that the element bearing
- * such a class becomes stretched inside its parent position: relative element.
- * The left/top/right/bottom specified below should reflect the corresponding
- * border radii and so it leaves room for the shadow:
- *     ..--------------------..
- *   ."        ^ top           ".
- *  /          v                 \
- * |     +------------------+     |
- * |     |                  |     |
- * | left|                  |right|
- * |<--->|                  |<--->|
- * |     +------------------+     |
- *  \          ^                 /
- *   `.        v bottom        .'
- *     ""--------------------""
- * The idea is that the top/left of the arrow container box does not move to a
- * coordinate smaller than the top/left of the guide and the right/bottom of
- * the arrow container box does not move to a coordinate larger than the
- * bottom/right of the guide. This will help us avoid the following situation:
- *        ..--------------------..
- *      ."        ^ top           ".
- *   /|/          v                 \
- *  / |     +------------------+     |
- *  \ |     |                  |     |
- *   \| left|                  |right|
- *    |<--->|                  |<--->|
- *    |     +------------------+     |
- *     \          ^                 /
- *      `.        v bottom        .'
- *        ""--------------------""
- * The arrow should not receive a top/left coordinate such that it is too close
- * to one of the corners, because then at first the shadow of the arrow and,
- * given a coordinate even closer to the corner, even the body of the arrow will
- * "stick out" of the corner of the popup. The guide provides a hint to the
- * arrow positioning code as to which range of values is acceptable for the
- * arrow container's top/left coordinate.

-/**
- * guide for the arrow - its width, height, and offset are theme-dependent and
- * should be expessed as left, right, top, bottom, so that the element bearing
- * such a class becomes stretched inside its parent position: relative element.
- * The left/top/right/bottom specified below should reflect the corresponding
- * border radii and so it leaves room for the shadow:
- *     ..--------------------..
- *   ."        ^ top           ".
- *  /          v                 \
- * |     +------------------+     |
- * |     |                  |     |
- * | left|                  |right|

- *  \          ^                 /
- *   `.        v bottom        .'
- *     ""--------------------""
- * The idea is that the top/left of the arrow container box does not move to a
- * coordinate smaller than the top/left of the guide and the right/bottom of
- * the arrow container box does not move to a coordinate larger than the
- * bottom/right of the guide. This will help us avoid the following situation:
- *        ..--------------------..
- *      ."        ^ top           ".
- *   /|/          v                 \
- *  / |     +------------------+     |
- *  \ |     |                  |     |
- *   \| left|                  |right|
- *    |<--->|                  |<--->|
- *    |     +------------------+     |
- *     \          ^                 /
- *      `.        v bottom        .'
- *        ""--------------------""
- * The arrow should not receive a top/left coordinate such that it is too close
- * to one of the corners, because then at first the shadow of the arrow and,
- * given a coordinate even closer to the corner, even the body of the arrow will
- * "stick out" of the corner of the popup. The guide provides a hint to the
- * arrow positioning code as to which range of values is acceptable for the
- * arrow container's top/left coordinate.

-	Implementation Summary
-

-	3. Use the same single mechanism to support "private" and "user" data.
-	4. _Never_ expose "private" data to user code (TODO: Drop _data, _removeData)
-	5. Avoid exposing implementation details on user objects (eg. expando properties)
-	6. Provide a clear path for implementation upgrade to WeakMap in 2014
