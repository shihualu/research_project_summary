 Change Log
 ==========
 
-## Version 3.11.0
-
-_2018-07-12_
-
- *  **OkHttp's new okhttp-tls submodule tames HTTPS and TLS.**
-
-    `HeldCertificate` is a TLS certificate and its private key. Generate a certificate with its
-    builder then use it to sign another certificate or perform a TLS handshake. The
-    `certificatePem()` method encodes the certificate in the familiar PEM format
-    (`--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ---`); the `privateKeyPkcs8Pem()` does likewise for the private key.
-
-    `HandshakeCertificates` holds the TLS certificates required for a TLS handshake. On the server
-    it keeps your `HeldCertificate` and its chain. On the client it keeps the root certificates
-    that are trusted to sign a server's certificate chain. `HandshakeCertificates` also works with
-    mutual TLS where these roles are reversed.
-
-    These classes make it possible to enable HTTPS in MockWebServer in [just a few lines of
-    code][https_server_sample].
-
- *  **OkHttp now supports prior knowledge cleartext HTTP/2.** Enable this by setting
-    `Protocol.H2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE` as the lone protocol on an `OkHttpClient.Builder`. This mode
-    only supports `http:` URLs and is best suited in closed environments where HTTPS is
-    inappropriate.
-
- *  New: `HttpUrl.get(String)` is an alternative to `HttpUrl.parse(String)` that throws an exception
-    when the URL is malformed instead of returning null. Use this to avoid checking for null in
-    situations where the input is known to be well-formed. We've also added `MediaType.get(String)`
-    which is an exception-throwing alternative to `MediaType.parse(String)`.
- *  New: The `EventListener` API previewed in OkHttp 3.9 has graduated to a stable API. Use this
-    interface to track metrics and monitor HTTP requests' size and duration.
- *  New: `okhttp-dnsoverhttps` is an experimental API for doing DNS queries over HTTPS. Using HTTPS
-    for DNS offers better security and potentially better performance. This feature is a preview:
-    the API is subject to change.
- *  New: `okhttp-sse` is an early preview of Server-Sent Events (SSE). This feature is incomplete
-    and is only suitable for experimental use.
- *  New: MockWebServer now supports client authentication (mutual TLS). Call `requestClientAuth()`
-    to permit an optional client certificate or `requireClientAuth()` to require one.
- *  New: `RecordedRequest.getHandshake()` returns the HTTPS handshake of a request sent to
-    `MockWebServer`.
- *  Fix: Honor the `MockResponse` header delay in MockWebServer.
- *  Fix: Don't release HTTP/2 connections that have multiple canceled calls. We had a bug where
-    canceling calls would cause the shared HTTP/2 connection to be unnecessarily released. This
-    harmed connection reuse.
- *  Fix: Ensure canceled and discarded HTTP/2 data is not permanently counted against the limited
-    flow control window. We had a few bugs where window size accounting was broken when streams
-    were canceled or reset.
- *  Fix: Recover gracefully if the TLS session returns an unexpected version (`NONE`) or cipher
-    suite (`SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`).
- *  Fix: Don't change Conscrypt configuration globally. We migrated from a process-wide setting to
-    configuring only OkHttp's TLS sockets.
- *  Fix: Prefer TLSv1.2 where it is available. On certain older platforms it is necessary to opt-in
-    to TLSv1.2.
- *  New: `Request.tag()` permits multiple tags. Use a `Class<?>` as a key to identify tags. Note
-    that `tag()` now returns null if the request has no tag. Previously this would return the
-    request itself.
- *  New: `Headers.Builder.addAll(Headers)`.
- *  New: `ResponseBody.create(MediaType, ByteString)`.
- *  New: Embed R8/ProGuard rules in the jar. These will be applied automatically by R8.
- *  Fix: Release the connection if `Authenticator` throws an exception.
- *  Fix: Change the declaration of `OkHttpClient.cache()` to return a `@Nullable Cache`. The return
-    value has always been nullable but it wasn't declared properly.
- *  Fix: Reverse suppression of connect exceptions. When both a call and its retry fail, we now
-    throw the initial exception which is most likely to be actionable.
- *  Fix: Retain interrupted state when throwing `InterruptedIOException`. A single interrupt should
-    now be sufficient to break out an in-flight OkHttp call.
- *  Fix: Don't drop a call to `EventListener.callEnd()` when the response body is consumed inside an
-    interceptor.
-
-
-## Version 3.10.0
-
-_2018-02-24_
-
- *  **The pingInterval() feature now aggressively checks connectivity for web
-    sockets and HTTP/2 connections.**
-
-    Previously if you configured a ping interval that would cause OkHttp to send
-    pings, but it did not track whether the reply pongs were received. With this
-    update OkHttp requires that every ping receive a response: if it does not
-    the connection will be closed and the listener's `onFailure()` method will
-    be called.
-
-    Web sockets have always been had pings, but pings on HTTP/2 connections is
-    new in this release. Pings are used for connections that are busy carrying
-    calls and for idle connections in the connection pool. (Pings do not impact
-    when pooled connections are evicted).
-
-    If you have a configured ping interval, you should confirm that it is long
-    enough for a roundtrip from client to server. If your ping interval is too
-    short, slow connections may be misinterpreted as failed connections. A ping
-    interval of 30 seconds is reasonable for most use cases.
-
- *  **OkHttp now supports [Conscrypt][conscrypt].** Conscrypt is a Java Security
-    Provider that integrates BoringSSL into the Java platform. Conscrypt
-    supports more cipher suites than the JVM’s default provider and may also
-    execute more efficiently.
-
-    To use it, first register a [Conscrypt dependency][conscrypt_dependency] in
-    your build system.
-
-    OkHttp will use Conscrypt if you set the `okhttp.platform` system property
-    to `conscrypt`.
-
-    Alternatively, OkHttp will also use Conscrypt if you install it as your
-    preferred security provider. To do so, add the following code to execute
-    before you create your `OkHttpClient`.
-
-    ```
-    Security.insertProviderAt(
-        new org.conscrypt.OpenSSLProvider(), 1);
-    ```
-
-    Conscrypt is the bundled security provider on Android so it is not necessary
-    to configure it on that platform.
-
- *  New: `HttpUrl.addQueryParameter()` percent-escapes more characters.
-    Previously several ASCII punctuation characters were not percent-escaped
-    when used with this method. This does not impact already-encoded query
-    parameters in APIs like `HttpUrl.parse()` and
-    `HttpUrl.Builder.addEncodedQueryParameter()`.
- *  New: CBC-mode ECDSA cipher suites have been removed from OkHttp's default
-    configuration: `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` and
-    `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`. This tracks a [Chromium
-    change][remove_cbc_ecdsa] to remove these cipher suites because they are
-    fragile and rarely-used.
- *  New: Don't fall back to common name (CN) verification for hostnames. This
-    behavior was deprecated with RFC 2818 in May 2000 and was recently dropped
-    from major web browsers.
- *  New: Honor the `Retry-After` response header. HTTP 503 (Unavailable)
-    responses are retried automatically if this header is present and its delay
-    is 0 seconds. HTTP 408 (Client Timeout) responses are retried automatically
-    if the header is absent or its delay is 0 seconds.
- *  New: Allow request bodies for all HTTP methods except GET and HEAD.
- *  New: Automatic module name of `okhttp3` for use with the Java Platform
-    Module System.
- *  New: Log gzipped bodies when `HttpLoggingInterceptor` is used as a network
-    interceptor.
- *  New: `Protocol.QUIC` constant. This protocol is not supported but this
-    constant is included for completeness.
- *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.14.0.
-
-     ```xml
-     <dependency>
-       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
-       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
-       <version>1.14.0</version>
-     </dependency>
-
-     com.squareup.okio:okio:1.14.0
-     ```
-
- *  Fix: Handle `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue` status lines, even on requests that did
-    not send the `Expect: continue` request header.
- *  Fix: Do not count web sockets toward the dispatcher's per-host connection
-    limit.
- *  Fix: Avoid using invalid HTTPS sessions. This prevents OkHttp from crashing
-    with the error, `Unexpected TLS version: NONE`.
- *  Fix: Don't corrupt the response cache when a 304 (Not Modified) response
-    overrides the stored "Content-Encoding" header.
- *  Fix: Gracefully shut down the HTTP/2 connection before it exhausts the
-    namespace of stream IDs (~536 million streams).
- *  Fix: Never pass a null `Route` to `Authenticator`. There was a bug where
-    routes were omitted for eagerly-closed connections.

- * DNS over HTTPS implementation.

- * Implementation of https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https-11
- *
- * <blockquote>A DNS API client encodes a single DNS query into an HTTP request
- * using either the HTTP GET or POST method and the other requirements
- * of this section.  The DNS API server defines the URI used by the
- * request through the use of a URI Template.</blockquote>
- *
- * <h3>Warning: This is a non-final API.</h3>
- *
- * <p><strong>As of OkHttp 3.11, this feature is an unstable preview: the API is subject to change,
- * and the implementation is incomplete. We expect that OkHttp 3.12 or 3.13 will finalize this API.
- * Until then, expect API and behavior changes when you update your OkHttp dependency.</strong>

-OkHttp TLS
-==========
-
-Approachable APIs for using TLS.
-
-A [`HeldCertificate`][held_certificate] is a certificate and its private key. Use the
-[builder][held_certificate_builder] to create a self-signed certificate that a test server can use
-for HTTPS:
-
-```java
-String localhost = InetAddress.getByName("localhost").getCanonicalHostName();
-HeldCertificate localhostCertificate = new HeldCertificate.Builder()
-    .addSubjectAlternativeName(localhost)
-    .build();
-```
-
-[`HandshakeCertificates`][handshake_certificates] keeps the certificates for a TLS handshake.
-Use its [builder][handshake_certificates_builder] to define which certificates the HTTPS server
-returns to its clients. The returned instance can create an `SSLSocketFactory` that implements this
-policy:
-
-```java
-HandshakeCertificates serverCertificates = new HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-    .heldCertificate(localhostCertificate)
-    .build();
-MockWebServer server = new MockWebServer();
-server.useHttps(serverCertificates.sslSocketFactory(), false);
-```
-
-`HandshakeCertificates` also works for clients where its job is to define which root certificates
-to trust. In this simplified example we trust the server's self-signed certificate:
-
-```java
-HandshakeCertificates clientCertificates = new HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-    .addTrustedCertificate(localhostCertificate.certificate())
-    .build();
-OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
-    .sslSocketFactory(clientCertificates.sslSocketFactory(), clientCertificates.trustManager())
-    .build();
-```
-
-With a server that holds a certificate and a client that trusts it we have enough for an HTTPS
-handshake. The best part of this example is that we don't need to make our test code insecure with a
-a fake `HostnameVerifier` or `X509TrustManager`.
-
-Certificate Authorities
------------------------
-
-The above example uses a self-signed certificate. This is convenient for testing but not
-representative of real-world HTTPS deployment. To get closer to that we can use `HeldCertificate`
-to generate a trusted root certificate, an intermediate certificate, and a server certificate.
-We use `certificateAuthority(int)` to create certificates that can sign other certificates. The
-int specifies how many intermediate certificates are allowed beneath it in the chain.
-
-```java
-HeldCertificate rootCertificate = new HeldCertificate.Builder()
-    .certificateAuthority(1)
-    .build();
-
-HeldCertificate intermediateCertificate = new HeldCertificate.Builder()
-    .certificateAuthority(0)
-    .signedBy(rootCertificate)
-    .build();
-
-String localhost = InetAddress.getByName("localhost").getCanonicalHostName();
-HeldCertificate serverCertificate = new HeldCertificate.Builder()
-    .addSubjectAlternativeName(localhost)
-    .signedBy(intermediateCertificate)
-    .build();
-```
-
-To serve this configuration the server needs to provide its clients with a chain of certificates
-starting with its own and including everything up-to but not including the root. We don't need to
-include root certificates because the client already has them.
-
-```java
-HandshakeCertificates serverHandshakeCertificates = new HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-    .heldCertificate(serverCertificate, intermediateCertificate.certificate())
-    .build();
-```
-
-The client only needs to know the trusted root certificate. It checks the server's certificate by
-validating the signatures within the chain.
-
-```java
-HandshakeCertificates clientCertificates = new HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-    .addTrustedCertificate(rootCertificate.certificate())
-    .build();
-OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
-    .sslSocketFactory(clientCertificates.sslSocketFactory(), clientCertificates.trustManager())
-    .build();
-```
-
-Client Authentication
----------------------
-
-The above scenario is representative of most TLS set ups: the client uses certificates to validate
-the identity of a server. The converse is also possible. Here we create a server that authenticates
-a client and a client that authenticates a server.
-
-```java
-// Create the root for client and server to trust. We could also use different roots for each!
-HeldCertificate rootCertificate = new HeldCertificate.Builder()
-    .certificateAuthority(0)
-    .build();
-
-// Create a server certificate and a server that uses it.
-HeldCertificate serverCertificate = new HeldCertificate.Builder()
-    .commonName("ingen")
-    .addSubjectAlternativeName(server.getHostName())
-    .signedBy(rootCertificate)
-    .build();
-HandshakeCertificates serverCertificates = new HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-    .addTrustedCertificate(rootCertificate.certificate())
-    .heldCertificate(serverCertificate)
-    .build();
-MockWebServer server = new MockWebServer();
-server.useHttps(serverCertificates.sslSocketFactory(), false);
-server.requestClientAuth();
-server.enqueue(new MockResponse());
-
-// Create a client certificate and a client that uses it.
-HeldCertificate clientCertificate = new HeldCertificate.Builder()
-    .commonName("ianmalcolm")
-    .signedBy(rootCertificate)
-    .build();
-HandshakeCertificates clientCertificates = new HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-    .addTrustedCertificate(rootCertificate.certificate())
-    .heldCertificate(clientCertificate)
-    .build();
-OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
-    .sslSocketFactory(clientCertificates.sslSocketFactory(), clientCertificates.trustManager())
-    .build();
-
-// Connect 'em all together. Certificates are exchanged in the handshake.
-Call call = client.newCall(new Request.Builder()
-    .url(server.url("/"))
-    .build());
-Response response = call.execute();
-System.out.println(response.handshake().peerPrincipal());
-RecordedRequest recordedRequest = server.takeRequest();
-System.out.println(recordedRequest.getHandshake().peerPrincipal());
-```
-
-This handshake is successful because each party has prearranged to trust the root certificate that
-signs the other party's chain.
-
-Well-Known Certificate Authorities
-----------------------------------
-
-In these examples we've prearranged which root certificates to trust. But for regular HTTPS on the
-Internet this set of trusted root certificates is usually provided by default by the host platform.
-Such a set typically includes many root certificates from well-known certificate authorities like
-Entrust and Verisign.
-
-This is the behavior you'll get with your OkHttpClient if you don't specifically configure
-`HandshakeCertificates`. Or you can do it explicitly with `addPlatformTrustedCertificates()`:
-
-```java
-HandshakeCertificates clientCertificates = new HandshakeCertificates.Builder()
-    .addPlatformTrustedCertificates()
-    .build();
-OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
-    .sslSocketFactory(clientCertificates.sslSocketFactory(), clientCertificates.trustManager())
-    .build();
-```
-
-PEM files
----------
-
-You can encode a `HeldCertificate` in PEM format:
-
-```java
-HeldCertificate heldCertificate = ...
-System.out.println(heldCertificate.certificatePem())
-```
-
-```
------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
-MIIBSjCB8aADAgECAgEBMAoGCCqGSM49BAMCMC8xLTArBgNVBAMTJDJiYWY3NzVl

-msOSMaAKwAePESf+AiBlxbEu6YpHt1ZJoAhMAv6raYnwSp/A94eJGlJynQ0igQ==
------END CERTIFICATE-----
-```
-
-You can also do so with the private key. Be careful with these!
-
-```java
-HeldCertificate heldCertificate = ...
-System.out.println(heldCertificate.privateKeyPkcs8Pem())
-```
-
-```
------BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

-OdHOim9+
------END PRIVATE KEY-----
-```
-
-Recommendations
----------------
-
-Typically servers need a held certificate plus a chain of intermediates. Servers only need the
-private key for their own certificate. The chain served by a server doesn't need the root
-certificate.
-
-The trusted roots don't need to be the same for client and server when using client authentication.
-Clients might rely on the platform certificates and servers might use a private
-organization-specific certificate authority.
-
-By default `HeldCertificate` instances expire after 24 hours. Use `duration()` to adjust.
-
-By default server certificates need to identify which hostnames they're trusted for. You may add as
-many as necessary with `addSubjectAlternativeName()`. This mechanism also supports a very limited
-form of wildcards `*.example.com` where the `*` must be first and doesn't match nested subdomains.
-
-By default certificates use fast and secure 256-bit ECDSA keys. For interoperability with very old
-clients use `HeldCertificate.Builder.rsa2048()`.

- * and that they own the hostnames that they represent. Server authentication is required.
- *
- * <p>To perform server authentication:
- *
- * <ul>
- *   <li>The server's handshake certificates must have a {@linkplain HeldCertificate held
- *       certificate} (a certificate and its private key). The certificate's subject alternative
- *       names must match the server's hostname. The server must also have is a (possibly-empty)
- *       chain of intermediate certificates to establish trust from a root certificate to the
- *       server's certificate. The root certificate is not included in this chain.
- *   <li>The client's handshake certificates must include a set of trusted root certificates. They
- *       will be used to authenticate the server's certificate chain. Typically this is a set of
- *       well-known root certificates that is distributed with the HTTP client or its platform. It
- *       may be augmented by certificates private to an organization or service.
- * </ul>
- *
- * <h3>Client Authentication</h3>
- *
- * <p>This is authentication of the client by the server during the TLS handshake. Client
- * authentication is optional.
- *
- * <p>To perform client authentication:
- *
- * <ul>
- *   <li>The client's handshake certificates must have a {@linkplain HeldCertificate held
- *       certificate} (a certificate and its private key). The client must also have a

-/**
- * A certificate and its private key. These are some properties of certificates that are used with
- * TLS:
- *
- * <ul>
- *   <li><strong>A common name.</strong> This is a string identifier for the certificate. It usually
- *       describes the purpose of the certificate like "Entrust Root Certification Authority - G2"
- *       or "www.squareup.com".
- *   <li><strong>A set of hostnames.</strong> These are in the certificate's subject alternative
- *       name (SAN) extension. A subject alternative name is either a literal hostname ({@code
- *       squareup.com}), a literal IP address ({@code 74.122.190.80}), or a hostname pattern ({@code
- *       *.api.squareup.com}).
- *   <li><strong>A validity interval.</strong> A certificate should not be used before its validity
- *       interval starts or after it ends.
- *   <li><strong>A public key.</strong> This cryptographic key is used for asymmetric encryption
- *       digital signatures. Note that the private key is not a part of the certificate!
- *   <li><strong>A signature issued by another certificate's private key.</strong> This mechanism
- *       allows a trusted third-party to endorse a certificate. Third parties should only endorse
- *       certificates once they've confirmed that the owner of the private key is also the owner of
- *       the certificate's other properties.
- * </ul>
- *
- * <p>Certificates are signed by other certificates and a sequence of them is called a certificate
- * chain. The chain terminates in a self-signed "root" certificate. Signing certificates in the
- * middle of the chain are called "intermediates". Organizations that offer certificate signing are
- * called certificate authorities (CAs).
- *
- * <p>Browsers and other HTTP clients need a set of trusted root certificates to authenticate their
- * peers. Sets of root certificates are managed by either the HTTP client (like Firefox), or the
- * host platform (like Android). In July 2018 Android had 134 trusted root certificates for its HTTP
- * clients to trust.
- *
- * <p>For example, in order to establish a secure connection to {@code https://www.squareup.com/},
- * these three certificates are used. <pre>{@code
- *
- * www.squareup.com certificate:
- *
- *   Common Name: www.squareup.com
- *   Subject Alternative Names: www.squareup.com, squareup.com, account.squareup.com...
- *   Validity: 2018-07-03T20:18:17Z – 2019-08-01T20:48:15Z
- *   Public Key: d107beecc17325f55da976bcbab207ba4df68bd3f8fce7c3b5850311128264fd53e1baa342f58d93...
- *   Signature: 1fb0e66fac05322721fe3a3917f7c98dee1729af39c99eab415f22d8347b508acdf0bab91781c3720...
- *
- * signed by intermediate certificate:
- *
- *   Common Name: Entrust Certification Authority - L1M
- *   Subject Alternative Names: none
- *   Validity: 2014-12-15T15:25:03Z – 2030-10-15T15:55:03Z
- *   Public Key: d081c13923c2b1d1ecf757dd55243691202248f7fcca520ab0ab3f33b5b08407f6df4e7ab0fb9822...
- *   Signature: b487c784221a29c0a478ecf54f1bb484976f77eed4cf59afa843962f1d58dea6f3155b2ed9439c4c4...
- *
- * signed by root certificate:
- *
- *   Common Name: Entrust Root Certification Authority - G2
- *   Subject Alternative Names: none
- *   Validity: 2009-07-07T17:25:54Z – 2030-12-07T17:55:54Z
- *   Public Key: ba84b672db9e0c6be299e93001a776ea32b895411ac9da614e5872cffef68279bf7361060aa527d8...
- *   Self-signed Signature: 799f1d96c6b6793f228d87d3870304606a6b9a2e59897311ac43d1f513ff8d392bc0f...
- *
- * }</pre>
- *
- * <p>In this example the HTTP client already knows and trusts the last certificate, "Entrust Root
- * Certification Authority - G2". That certificate is used to verify the signature of the
- * intermediate certificate, "Entrust Certification Authority - L1M". The intermediate certificate
- * is used to verify the signature of the "www.squareup.com" certificate.
- *
- * <p>This roles are reversed for client authentication. In that case the client has a private key
- * and a chain of certificates. The server uses a set of trusted root certificates to authenticate
- * the client. Subject alternative names are not used for client authentication.
