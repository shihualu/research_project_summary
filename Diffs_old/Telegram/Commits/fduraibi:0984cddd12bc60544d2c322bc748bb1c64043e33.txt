-##Creating your Telegram Application
-
-We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
-There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.
-
-1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.
-2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
-3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
-3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
-4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.

-### Usage
-
-**Beware of using the dev branch and uploading it to any markets, in many cases it not will work as expected**.

-First of all, take a look at **src/main/java/org/telegram/messenger/BuildVars.java** and fill it with correct values.
-Import the root folder into your IDE (tested on Android Studio), then run project.

-### Localization

-We moved all translations to https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/telegram/. Please use it.
+Due to the irresponsible behavior and awkward policy of Telegram company, and after they have taken my username @Fahad and given it to someone else without even asking me or notifying me I decided to delete my telegram account and stop the development of Telegram Ultra. And whoever was contacting me through that username should stop since it is not me anymore!
