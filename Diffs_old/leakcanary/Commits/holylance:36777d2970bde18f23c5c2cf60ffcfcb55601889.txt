 # Change Log
 
-## Version 2.0 Alpha 3 (2019-07-04)
+## Version 2.0 Beta 1 (2019-17-30)
+
+LeakCanary 2 reached **beta status**: the internals and APIs are mostly stable.
+
+Now is a great time to adopt it and provide feedback before the stable release. We're counting on you to find bugs and suggest improvements! Check out the new [Getting Started](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/getting_started) instructions and the [migration guide](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/upgrading-to-leakcanary-2.0/). 
+
+* New standalone library! [Shark](shark.md) is the heap analyzer that powers LeakCanary 2, and it can run in any Java VM. It comes with a [CLI](shark.md#shark-cli): you can now run `shark-cli analyze-process com.example.myapp` from your computer.
+* New Heap Explorer directly on device! Open a Heap Analysis in LeakCanary, tap the options menu and select "Heap Explorer". This is still experimental and not very user friendly, contributions welcome!
+* **Large API rewrite** to improve usability. If you used the alpha with a customized configuration, there are breaking changes. Of note: LeakSentry became [AppWatcher](/api/leakcanary-object-watcher-android/leakcanary/-app-watcher/), RefWatcher became [ObjectWatcher](/api/leakcanary-object-watcher/leakcanary/-object-watcher/), AndroidExcludedRefs became [AndroidReferenceMatchers](/api/shark-android/shark/-android-reference-matchers/), AnalysisResultListener became [OnHeapAnalyzedListener](/api/leakcanary-android-core/leakcanary/-on-heap-analyzed-listener/), AndroidLeakTraceInspectors became [AndroidObjectInspectors](/api/shark-android/shark/-android-object-inspectors/).
+* The entire API surface is now documented and the documentation is available on this website: try the search bar at the top and **LeakCanary API ∨** in the navigation menu.
+* Removed the **dependency on Android X**. No more configuration issues! [#1462](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1462) 
+* Added **Proguard rules** for LeakCanary and ObjectWatcher. [#1500](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1500) 
+* Display LeakCanary version in the About screen. [#1448](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1448) 
+* Bug fixes, new reference matchers and object inspectors

 ## Can a leak be caused by the Android SDK?
 
-Yes. There are a number of known memory leaks that have been fixed over time in AOSP as well as in manufacturer implementations.

For that reason, LeakCanary has a built-in list of known Android leaks to ignore: [AndroidExcludedRefs.kt](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/leakcanary-analyzer/src/main/java/leakcanary/AndroidExcludedRefs.kt).

 ### Detecting retained instances
 
-The foundation of LeakCanary is a library called Object Watcher Android. It hooks into the Android lifecycle to automatically detect when activities and fragments are destroyed and should be garbage collected. These destroyed instances are passed to an `ObjectWatcher`, which holds weak references to them. You can also watch any instance that is no longer needed, e.g. a detached view, a destroyed presenter, etc.

These destroyed instances are passed to an `ObjectWatcher`, which holds weak references to them. You can also watch any instance that is no longer needed, for example a detached view, a destroyed presenter, etc.
 
 If the weak references aren't cleared after waiting 5 seconds and running the garbage collector, the watched instances are considered *retained*, and potentially leaking.
 
 ### Dumping the heap
 
-When the number of retained instances reaches a threshold, LeakCanary dumps the Java heap into a `.hprof` file stored onto the Android file system. The default threshold is 5 retained instances when the app is visible, 1 otherwise.

+4. **Shark Android**: Android heuristics to generate tailored heap analysis reports.
+5. **Shark CLI**: Analyze the heap of debuggable apps installed on an Android device connected to your desktop. The output is similar to the output of LeakCanary, except you don't have to add the LeakCanary dependency to your app.
+6. **LeakCanary**: Builds on top. It automatically watches destroyed activities and fragments, triggers a heap dump, runs Shark Android and then displays the result.
 
-Shark is also released as a CLI tool, `Shark CLI`.
+A few more things:
 
-## Example usage
+* Shark is built on top of Okio. Okio makes it easy to parse heap dumps efficiently.
+* Shark is a 100% Kotlin library, and Kotlin is essential to its design, because Shark relies heavily on sealed classes and sequences to save memory.
+* Shark has the unique ability to help narrow down the cause of memory leaks through platform specific [heuristics](fundamentals.md#heuristics-and-labels).
+* Shark is heavily tested (80% test coverage).
+* Shark can run in both Java and Android VMs, with no other dependency than Okio and Kotlin.
+* Shark can analyze both Java and Android VM hprof files.
 
-### Reading records in a hprof file with shark-hprof
+## Shark CLI
+
+The Shark Command Line Interface (CLI) enables you to analyze heaps directly from your computer. It can dump the heap of an app installed on a connected Android device, analyze it, and even strip a heap dump of any sensitive data (e.g. PII, passwords or encryption keys) which is useful when sharing a heap dump.
+
+Download it [here](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/releases/download/v2.0-beta-1/shark-cli-2.0-beta-1.zip)!
+
+Usage instructions:
